When a website doesn't include "www" at the beginning of its URL, it simply means that the website is configured to work without the "www" prefix. Both "https://example.com" and "https://www.example.com" can point to the same website, but they don't have to. This is a matter of how the domain and its subdomains are set up.

Here’s a bit more detail:

Subdomain vs. Root Domain: "www" is technically a subdomain of the root domain. So, "example.com" is the root domain, and "www.example.com" is a subdomain.

Configuration: Website administrators can configure their domains to respond to requests with or without "www". They often set up redirects to ensure users end up on the correct version, maintaining consistency and aiding SEO.

SEO and User Experience: It's common to choose one version (with or without "www") as the canonical version for SEO purposes. Consistency helps avoid duplicate content issues and can improve search engine rankings.

DNS Settings: In the Domain Name System (DNS) settings, the root domain (example.com) and the "www" subdomain can be directed to the same server IP address, ensuring the same website is served regardless of which URL is used.

In summary, whether a URL includes "www" or not depends on the site's configuration and both can effectively point to the same content.
